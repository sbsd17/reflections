When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to do collaboration, sharing your code to work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might be working on your local code and automatically pulling what is online, especially if you are collaborating with others who have made changes to the github repository might break your code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
You fork a repository when you want to clone another repository into your account to be able to modify it. Clone is making a copy of a remote repository into our local working encvironment. Create a branch so we can modify it with out affecting our original code like for testing experimental functionalities. This can be done both locally and remotely.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So as  to be able to view or merge with your work  later even if you cannot connect with the remote repository

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
without using git or git hub, you would have to zip all file, send to other team members and there will be a lot of inconsistences and version differences. Git together with github helps you collaborating efficiently and provise version control.
